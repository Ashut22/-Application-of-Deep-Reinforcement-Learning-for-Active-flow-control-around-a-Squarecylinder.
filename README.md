# Active Flow Control Around a Confined Square Cylinder Using Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Objective
To leverage Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for active flow control around a confined square cylinder, aiming to optimize drag coefficient reduction.

## Approach
1. **Understanding Fluid Dynamics**: 
   - Applied Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques to improve simulation accuracy and efficiency in drag coefficient calculations.
2. **Baseline Calculations**: 
   - Computed initial drag coefficients without DRL using the Marker-and-Cell (MAC) method and Fortran-based CFD simulations.
3. **Learning and Implementation**: 
   - Studied Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning (DQL) algorithms.
   - Successfully implemented DQL in the MountainCarContinuous environment.
4. **Advanced DRL Techniques**: 
   - Applied DRL methodologies in simulation environments for accurate drag coefficient optimization.

## Results
- **Without DRL**: Achieved a drag coefficient of **1.55**.
- **With DRL**: Reduced the drag coefficient to **1.36**, representing a **12.26% reduction** for a Reynolds number (Re) of 100.

## Key Contributions
- Demonstrated the potential of DRL in fluid dynamics applications.
